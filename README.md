# dtmoney-next

This is a project developed during the Ignite ReactJS trail from [Rockeset](https://www.rocketseat.com.br) Program. However, this one i've extended to be a full app using NextJS and API consumption.

## Getting Started

First, you'll need to create a mongoDB. Then take your DATABASE_URL and set at `mongoose.ts` file.

Run the development server:

`yarn dev`
